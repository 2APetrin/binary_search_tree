# Binary search tree implementation

It's a set, which has much faster distance method.

## project launch

1. copying project
```
git clone https://github.com/2APetrin/binary_search_tree.git
cd binary_search_tree
```

2. making
```
cmake -B build
cd build
make
```

3. launching programm:
```
./src/avl - to get answer
./src/compare - to compare speed with std::set
```

4. end-to-end tests
( from *binary_search_tree* directory ):
```
./test/tests.sh
```
